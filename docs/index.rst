Introduction
------------

**(Python Library for Accurate Space Magnetometer Adjustments with
GUI)**

PLASMAG is a simulation software specifically designed for space
magnetometers. At its core, PLASMAG serves as a comprehensive tool for
the parameters adjustment.

Currently, PLASMAG is tailored to support search coil type instruments.
However, its architecture is built with flexibility and extensibility in
mind. This means PLASMAG is not only limited to current implementations
but is also designed to easily accommodate the addition of new
instruments and the integration of diverse calculation methods and
models.
