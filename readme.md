# PLASMAG 
**Python Library for Accurate Space Magnetometer Adjustments with Gui**

PLASMAG is a simulation software specifically designed for 
space magnetometers.
At its core, PLASMAG serves as a comprehensive tool for the parameters adjustment.

Currently, PLASMAG is tailored to support search coil type instruments.
However, its architecture is built with flexibility and extensibility in mind. This 
means PLASMAG is not only limited to current implementations but is also designed to 
easily accommodate the addition of new instruments and the integration of diverse 
calculation methods and models.
